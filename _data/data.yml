  title: "Network Knowledge on the Move: How Worker Mobility Shapes Firm Connections"
  summary: " I examine the transfer of supplier and customer knowledge by employees as they transition between firms. Leveraging a unique dataset that combines employer-employee matched data with comprehensive firm-to-firm transaction records, I quantify the impact of worker transitions on a recruiting firm's ability to acquire new customers from the networks of the employee's previous employers. By exploiting variations in workers' exposure to different customer portfolios, I demonstrate that customer-specific knowledge significantly increases the likelihood of the recruiting firm forming new business connections by 15% on average. Moreover, the findings reveal that workers transferring valuable network knowledge experience substantial wage premiums, suggesting that the labor market recognizes and rewards the dissemination of such strategic information."

    summary: "Employee spinoffs—firms founded by former employees of established companies—consistently outperform unrelated entrants. This study investigates the underlying drivers of this advantage, with a focus on the inheritance of critical customer and supplier knowledge from parent firms. Using comprehensive administrative data on Turkish firms from 2006 to 2020, including firm-to-firm transaction records and matched employer-employee data, we show that inherited value chain knowledge plays a crucial role in spinoffs' superior performance. This inherited social capital explains over half of the observed performance gap, with a one-standard-deviation increase in inherited connections linked to a 20% rise in real sales. By identifying this key mechanism for entrepreneurial success, our research deepens the understanding of how prior employment and firm-specific knowledge create enduring advantages for new ventures, advancing both entrepreneurship theory and practice."
